### Hi there 👋

*Information Engineering student at Gadjah Mada University.* I have a lot things to be working on since I've only started learning about this information engineering field after entering university and i eagerly wanna be ✨better✨ at this field like that one chocolate treat you might like. I am also interested on learning about cyber security that is seemingly more critical nowadays. Looking thoroughly for advice and help from anyone🙆‍♂️.
